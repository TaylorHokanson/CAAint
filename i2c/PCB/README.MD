###Seeed Fusion PCB Design Notes
Some of the following are hard and fast rules. Others are just there to qualify for a discount.

1. 100 x 100 mm
2. Panelized designs can only feature two variations
3. Smallest trace/clearance is 6/6 mil
   - Work larger whenever possible
   - Edit > Net Classes to establish t/c families
4. Circuit-to-edge: .3mm
5. Circuit-to-V groove: .8mm
   - Seeed DRC will not catch this
   - Measured from V groove centerline
